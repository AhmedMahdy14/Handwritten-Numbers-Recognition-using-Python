# Handwritten-Numbers-Recognition-using-Python

I didn't implement all things from scratch but i make a search and understand many algorithms and then put some edits on them.
Our neural network has 3 layers { an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Recall that our inputs are pixel values of
digit images. Since the images are of size 20*20, this gives us 400 input layer units (excluding the extra bias unit which always outputs +1). 
Our initial Theta are stored in ex3weights.mat and will be loaded by ex3 nn.m into Theta1 and Theta2 The parameters have dimensions
that are sized for a neural network with 25 units in the second layer and 10 output units (corresponding to the 10 digit classes).
